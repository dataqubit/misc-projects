# Miscellaneous Projects 

This is a home for initial exploration of potential data science projects.

When a project is matured enough it will be moved to its own newly created repository.

# List of Potential Projects

* Modified Version of Game of Life in Golang. 

The original project is github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/tree/master/examples/life

This is not a cellular automaton in a strict sense. 
There is a probability for a cell to die at every step that depends 
on the ratio of live cells ratioDelay steps before. 
This delay of ratioDelay steps is introduced to observe a cyclic behavior in population. 

Combination of ratioDelay = (20 to 50) 
and initLiveCellFactor=50 leads to cyclic population.

To me it's just a fun project to practice Go. 

* Building Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Interactive Graph using historical data.

This is based on Cytoscape within Python Dash (https://dash.plot.ly/cytoscape/)
Data source: https://github.com/WarrierRajeev/UFC-Predictions
